Morning Wombats. 

Week 2 is in the books. And never a finer night was seen by us all. In fact at times we couldn’t see much of anything including apres in the parking lot. We blame that on no ZGS to be our spirit leader…

Looks worse than it was. Really, that’s what we keep telling ourselves. Way up there by the shake shack with Jack in-the-box you’ll see the Wombat triangle. That should be our rallying point for the weekly  MySelfie™ by Roger. 

Use the timer, Roger, the timer.

Handsome crew if there ever was one.

So how was the snow? Not fluffy you can be sure. It was spring like thick and was incredibly and rather unexpectedly fun to ski on race skis. Pretty sure everyone enjoyed it and for that one person that may not have, pfffft. 

Results are in. the unofficial count was one more win than actualized. Sorry, Pyle, no wins for you. This week we have two LVI’s (Least Valuable Ian) at zero wins for both. 

We netted 19 points with 7 wins and 5 team points. Two weeks in a row. Nice work kiddies all. 

Oakes, ReadyFur, and DonnyBrooke (ME!) had two wins each. 
Tweed – one 
Chumps – none

Just remember chump one week hero the following. Which goes to this week’s MVW – drum roll please… 

MVW goes to the comeback kid, Oak Tree for two wins after embarrassing his family tree and spawn with two losses last week. Way to go you lumbering galoot in learning to trust those race skis. For low end racers like us it seems to be about getting the edge-to-edge thing down. Probably need to go to TC’s race clinic. P.S. he beat a boarder, not a border collie as previously rumored.

But, read on, we’re going to have an often-unused asterisk there. A gold star is awarded to our returning racer, Todd – formerly Toddler, now 6-million-dollar man – Laney for running a qualifying run. He did pretty good on his one run relative to prior performance however he was first racer on a virgin (can I use that word anymore?), rut free course that was trustworthy, fun, and fog free for the moment. For the record, 6MDM might be too obscure so likely we will stick with Toddler. Bad enough we’re going to have to remember where “Pyle” comes from.

LVW is a difficult one this week. We all had pretty good time. LVW goes to the entire team for bailing on parking lot après. But that is too broad of an assignment, so LVW goes to ZGS for not being there to get “this party started” in the lot. Instead, he was doing something mammoth.

As you can see, from the top of the course it was scenic AF.

There is one thing I’d like to point out in Thursday night’s finishes that stood out in the results. Finish times and LVI’s contribution to team points both (good thing I’m the author of this weekly letter, I’ll be far more kind when I, personally, fall short).

Next week is slow to fast. Need me to explain that to you?

Parting shot of the beautiful people. 

Btw hotdogs at Mt. Si tavern were surprisingly good, thanks for the clue, Tweed.


Xxxooo
