Welcome to 2022 Wombats and Wombat Groupies - 

First let's start with the groupies part. Besides the usual groupie week to week, TheCouch, we had a new groupie. This groupie, Nylie LastNameRedacted, deserves 
*honorable mention* for doing what no non-racing Wombat did - showed up and took in the (shit) show.

Let's visit the drive up the mountain last night. A lot like week 6 last year - heavy rain and cussing out of Jack until about milepost 51, then you 
came around the turn and... snow. Seemingly a fair bit of it. Optimism suddenly sunk in. Optimism crushed the moment you stepped out of the car. It was pure slop. 
Plain and simple slop. Okay... Get this - Even Mikko abandoned his race skis for some fatties - unfortuntately his opponent didn't.

How did we do? Let me just say... 
## That ZGS got *MVW* with the only two wins

That's it, we got two wins. At this point we've got the enemy right where we want 'em - clear out in front of the standings.

LVW - for the rest of us for not "running with what we brung". Though, tbh, nobody fell and DNF'd. Lot to be said about that! 

Dear reader, you must understand we even brought in our rebel pilot fresh from her star fighter and yet we could not extract another win.

How much fun were the conditions last night. This next picture kind of explains it.

*This may look good but its a trap!*

Needless to say that for next week I should be mentioning a need for our 'A' game. Honestly, we just need a game first. Thanks ZGS for those four points.
