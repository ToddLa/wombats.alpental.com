# Welcome to WOMBATS.APLENTAL.COM

This is a GitHub pages site using the Jekyll Cayman theme, and I hacked the `_layouts/default.html` and the `assets/css/style.scss`

`index.html` is the `Home` page 

any other top level `Markdown` file will be shown in the nav bar, using the frontmatter `title`

# Photos

the `Photos` page will automaticly show all images in the `Photos/` sub directory.  The file name will be used as a title, unless it is IMG_####.

# Posts

if you add a file to the `_posts` directory a link to it will be added to the home page with an excerpt.  the file must be named `YYYY-MM-DD-Title.md` just copy an existing post and edit it.
